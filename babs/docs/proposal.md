<th><p><strong>Project Summary</strong></p>
<p>Following on from Project SP22016 we now want to perform Slide-seq on a pest fly species <em>Glossina morsitans.</em> Again, as many pairs of dissected antenna as possible will be placed inside a 3mm diameter in a grid arrangement in order to get more replicates per puck and hopefully providing some landmark reference information when clustering libraries. Antennae of <em>Glossina morsitans</em> are significantly larger 700um * 200um so we should have a greater chance of separating out individual pairs on antenna and hopefully see changes in spatial expression of different chemosensory genes with the ideal goal of being able to inform electrophysiological experiments.</p>
<p>If dataset generated looks promising I will also follow up with a single cell or nuclei sequencing experiment to get more accurate cell type information.</p></th>

<td><p><strong>Experimental Approach:</strong></p>
<p>Please include details such as the number of biological and / or technical replicates:</p>
<p>As the tissue we want to test is small (700um * 200um) we will arrange the tissues in a grid pattern and mount in OCT. We will then take several sections (10um) through the grid of tissues in order to fit as many individual antennal segments onto each puck.</p>
<p>Because it will be very difficult to follow the same individual antenna through each section we would consider each cryoblock to be a biological replicate and each section close to a technical replicate. Even though we will be sectioning different planes of the cryoblock between each section we will also be sectioning different inter-antennal planes.</p>
<p>This time I will try to take 3 sections from each of two separate pucks to see how repeatable expression patterns are across samples. I will image interleaving sections in order to have a visual representation of how many antenna should be present on each puck.</p></td>

***By submitting this form, you are confirming that your PI has agreed
on the project and that the cost-code can be used for this purpose.***

Please be aware that the number of hours listed to do the analysis is an
estimate and numbers may change. If the project takes longer than
estimated you will be informed, and a new estimation will require
approval before continuing. Likewise, if a project takes less time than
the initial estimate you will be charged accordingly.

This charge does not affect the [Crick's authorship
policy](https://intranet.crick.ac.uk/our-crick/research-integrity/pages/publication-authorship):
regardless of whether it is Core or Grant funded, we generally expect
our significant contribution to be recognised in papers - if this needs
discussion, please do so at the project proposal meeting.
