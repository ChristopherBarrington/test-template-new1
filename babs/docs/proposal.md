|                                   | format) for inclusion in a        |

|                                   | characterising a population of    |

|                                   | Biologically, we are interested   |
|                                   | to know what these sorted         |
|                                   | populations of cells are, whether |
|                                   | they are equivalent to embryonic  |
|                                   | PGCs, and particularly, which     |
|                                   | timepoint they are most similar   |
|                                   | to. As such, the analysis         |
